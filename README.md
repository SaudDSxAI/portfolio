This repository brings together two complementary applications that showcase the integration of agentic AI, large language models (LLMs), and LangChain with modern web interfaces. The first is an AI assistant that autonomously ingests and summarizes documents and GitHub repositories, transforming static information into a conversational knowledge agent accessible through a Streamlit chat interface. The second is a Streamlit-based portfolio website, designed as a clean and interactive showcase of professional information and projects. Together, they demonstrate how LLM-powered agentic systems can create both dynamic, queryable assistants and polished, user-friendly frontends for presenting personal or organizational profiles.
