# Agentic AI Projects
**Autonomous, intelligent agents in action—experimentation, learning, and real-world automation.**
This repository showcases an evolving collection of **Agentic AI projects**—autonomous agents built for real-world tasks using modern AI frameworks. Each project demonstrates a unique capability, from web scraping to resume parsing and conversational agents, designed as foundations for future innovation.

## Projects Overview

- **agentic-webscraper** – Autonomous web-crawling agent capable of fetching and parsing content from target websites.
- **first-resume-parser** – A prototype parser to extract structured resume information (e.g., emails, names, skills).
- **phidata-resume-parser** – An advanced version, built with more robustness, data handling, or feature enhancements.
- **langchain-assistant** – Agent built using LangChain for multi-step workflows, tool integration, and memory.
- **langgraph-chatbot** – Chat agent with stateful workflows and branching logic, powered by LangGraph.
- **seerah-assistant** – Domain-specific assistant (e.g., for Seerah content), showcasing contextual QA or task execution.

## Key Themes & Frameworks

- **Agentic AI paradigms**: autonomous reasoning, tool integration, memory, and iterative workflows.
- **LangChain & LangGraph**: building blocks for multimodal, memory-augmented, multi-step agents.  
  - LangChain empowers agents with tools, memory, and prompt chaining. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
  - LangGraph enables stateful, directed-graph workflows—ideal for orchestrating complex agent behavior. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
- **Real-world relevance**: These agents align with the evolving landscape of autonomous AI systems, observable in frameworks like OpenAI Agents SDK (multi-agent orchestration with tracing) :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} and industry trends of replacing static models with adaptable agents. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Saud0346/CV/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```
